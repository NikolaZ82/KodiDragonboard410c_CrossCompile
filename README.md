# KodiDragonboard410c_CrossCompile
Cross-compile Kodi for Dragonboard410c on Ubuntu 16.04


Inspired by the effort od asciper user to bring us Kodi for Dragonboard410c, I decided to it was time to start improving the build process.


After witnesing difficalties in compiling Kodi on Dragonboard410c - sloow build, overheating, board crashing during library linking process, it bacame obvious to me that cross compiling is very musch needed.
Since there was no corss compile support for Kodi on Dragonboard410c, like ther is for Raspberry Pi, it seemed like a good idea to create a procedure for cross-compiling Kodi on Ubuntu.

Ubuntu version I used and tested on is 16.04.

Work was based on KodiDragonboard410c repository created by asciper:  https://github.com/asciper/KodiDragonboard410c
Patches I created are modifications to asciper patches.



I hope users will find this useful!

Enjoy!
